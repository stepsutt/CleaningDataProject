run_analysis.R is the R code which downloads the zipped data, extracts and manipulate the data before writing the tidy data set (tidyData2.txt).

CodeBook.md details the format of tidyData2.txt and all transformations that were performed on the original data.

run_analysis.R can be run standalone as it creates folders (where neeeded) and will overwrite to create the final output file.
